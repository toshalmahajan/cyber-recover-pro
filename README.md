🎯 Use Cases
Digital Forensics - Evidence recovery from disk images

Incident Response - Data recovery from compromised systems

Data Recovery - Retrieving files from corrupted media

Educational - Learning file systems and data recovery techniques

Cybersecurity Projects - Academic and professional applications

🔬 Technical Details
CyberRecover Pro uses file carving technology that scans for file signatures (magic numbers) rather than relying on file system metadata. This allows recovery even when:

File system is corrupted or formatted

Files are deleted but not overwritten

Disk partitions are damaged

Metadata is lost or incomplete

How File Carving Works:
Scan - Read disk sectors looking for known file signatures

Identify - Detect file types by their unique "magic numbers"

Extract - Recover file data based on signature boundaries

Verify - Validate recovered files and generate hashes

📋 Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

rich - Beautiful terminal formatting

questionary - Interactive prompts

psutil - System information

pyyaml - YAML report generation
